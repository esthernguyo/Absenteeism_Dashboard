### Overview  
Developing an analytical Power BI dashboard to explore patterns of workplace absenteeism and their links to demographic and health behavioural factors.  
Python preprocessing and exploratory analysis have been completed, laying the foundation for dashboard visualisation and KPI tracking in Power BI.

### Current Progress  
- Cleaned and prepared **1,000+ workforce records** using Python (Pandas, NumPy, Seaborn).  
- Generated descriptive statistics and visualised absenteeism trends by lifestyle and demographic variables.  
- Identified a **2× higher productivity loss** among employees with lower healthy lifestyle scores, informing data-driven wellness strategies.  
- Power BI dashboard design in development (to integrate DAX-based KPI measures and interactive insights).

### Next Steps  
- Continue building Power BI dashboard to visualise absenteeism cost, productivity loss, and lifestyle trends.  
- Develop interactive filters for health behaviours and department-level insights.  
- Publish final dashboard visuals and workflow documentation.

### Tools & Techniques  
- **Python:** Pandas, NumPy, Seaborn  
- **Power BI:** DAX measures (planned), KPI cards, interactive visuals  
- **Excel:** Data cleaning and structure validation  
- **Public Health Analytics:** Workforce wellness and behavioural analysis
